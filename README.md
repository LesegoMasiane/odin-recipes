This project tests basic html and css knowledge as part of www.theodinproject.com foundation projects. NB: Flex-box not used in this exercise. I completed the project but the live page preview weren't working so I deleted the repositiory and started over but the html files have been coded. so there won't be a lot of staging and commits in the log.
